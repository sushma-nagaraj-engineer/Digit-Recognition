# Digit-Recognition

In this project the team and I have made a small attempt to demonstrate the capability of Machine learning techniques in recognition of handwritten text. The MNIST dataset obtained will be trained by applying deep learning techniques using TensorFlow.  TensorFlow is a framework used to create deep learning models. The entire project is aimed at applying the best possible technique which aids in increasing the accuracy of results.
